                    including astronomy, physics, philosophy, and metaphysics.
                    The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</p>

                <p>This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The Big Bang
                    theory suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years
                    ago.
                    As a result of the Big Bang, time, space,
                    and all matter were created,
                    leading to the expansion of the cosmos.</p>

                    not even light, can escape.
                    Black holes interact with nearby matter
                    and can emit radiation.</p>
